# 7tv-downloader

Uses selenium and python to download the first few pages of emotes from 7tv.app

## setup

Use your favorite way to create a virtual environment, then install
```
pip install selenium requests
```

## Usage

Create an empty `emotes` directory, e.g.
```
mkdir emotes
```

and just run the script with `python main.py`. It downloads the first 10 pages of emotes, 30 per page, so 300 in total.

## Disclaimer

I just used this as a learning opportunity, so no fancy parameters or something. Make changes to the script to fit your needs, its not rocket science.
